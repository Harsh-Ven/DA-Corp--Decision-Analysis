Project Overview: Decision Strategy for Cyclone Enzyme Commercialization

Daylight Alchemy Corporation (DAC) stands at a pivotal decision point concerning the future of its innovative Cyclone Enzyme—a bio-engineered solution with the potential to convert waste into energy, offering high value to both environmental and industrial markets.

This project applies the Decision Analysis (DA) Cycle—Formulation, Evaluation, Appraisal, and Decide—to systematically evaluate DAC’s strategic options.

After thorough analysis, our team recommends a No Partnership / No Expansion strategy. If the Cyclone Enzyme proves to be a technical and commercial success, this path offers the greatest long-term value. It allows DAC to:

1. Maximize financial returns

2. Retain full control of intellectual property

3. Strengthen internal technical expertise

4. Establish itself as a leader in innovation# DA Corp- Decision Analysis
